        <h1>TOP THINGS TO DO IN HANOI:</h1>

        <h2>Sample the street food</h2>

        <h4>A wander around a morning market provides a tantalising hint of what you can expect to hit your table in
            Hanoi. For an authentic taste of Hanoi, look no further than the street kitchens of the Old Quarter. Phở
            noodle soup is king of cuisines here, with steaming pots of its star anise-infused broth simmering on every
            corner; while every day, the irresistible scent of bún chả fills the air as barbecued pork sizzles over hot
            coals. In recent years a growing band of superb international dining rooms have emerged, serving everything
            from contemporary tapas to fusion fare</h4>

        <h2>Stroll the Old Quarter</h2>

        <h4>Hanoi’s Old Quarter serves up a sensory overload for the eyes, ears and nose. Wisps of incense drift out
            onto streets from ancient temples painted a riot of reds and oranges, while in a far-flung corner the clang
            of a blacksmith’s hammer mingles with a mobile fruit seller’s call. To fully immerse yourself, grab a map to
            explore. Or jump in a cyclo and take a tour of this intoxicating maze of markets, street kitchens, shop
            houses, and more. <h/4>

                <h2>Explore Hanoi's cafe culture</h2>

                <h4>It is by taking a seat and waiting as your coffee slowly filters that the Vietnamese capital can
                    best be understood. Fast-paced on the surface, the true rhythm of city life is far from hurried.
                    Alongside the thousands of coffee houses selling traditional Vietnamese coffee, an ever-growing band
                    of unique coffee shops serve espressos and macchiatos in surroundings rivaling the world’s coolest
                    caffeine dens.</h4>

                <h2>Check out the art scene</h2>

                <h4>Hanoi has long had a reputation as Vietnam’s art capital, with the elegant Fine Arts Museum housing
                    the country’s foremost collection, including ancient Cham artifacts and impressionist pieces. For
                    something more contemporary, head for Manzi--an art space-cum-cafe--or the Vietnam Art Gallery. Both
                    are top places to take the pulse of the city’s art scene. Smaller gallery spaces include Nha San
                    Collective at the up-and-coming Hanoi Creative City urban project.</h4>

                <h2>Join the locals at Hoan Kiem Lake</h2>
                <h4>Hoan Kiem lake rests at the heart of Hanoi and embodies the soul of the city. Every morning it comes
                    alive with walkers, aerobics classes, badminton, ballroom dancers, and even a laughing yoga group.
                    It bursts back into life at sunset, and after dark, is again thronged with locals out to take the
                    evening air. A little further north the lesser-visited Truc Bach and West Lake shouldn’t be
                    missed--their calm temples and lakeside cafes provide peaceful enclaves away from the buzz of
                    downtown</h4>
                <h2>Ha Noi Weather</h2>
                <h4>The climate is inviting from April to June, but Hanoi is particularly beautiful in May when its many
                    trees come into bloom – orange, white, purple and red flowers elevate the already beguiling street
                    scenes to another level. October and November are also excellent months to visit when temperatures
                    are cooler.</h4>

                <h2>Transport to Ha Noi</h2>
                <h4>Hanoi is served by Noi Bai international airport as well as trains. A bus network links all major
                    destinations within the country and international buses also link the capital with Laos.</h5>
